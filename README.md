## Hi, I'm Gus ðŸ‘‹
#### and I'm a full-stack developer

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on a virtual budtender. Repo is private for now, but shoot me a line
- ðŸ¤”  Iâ€™m looking for help with building a search engine from scratch (aren't we all)
- ðŸ˜„  Pronouns only make sense for people who have a gendered experience of life. That's not exactly the case with me
